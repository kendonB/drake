\title{Function \code{expand_plan}}
\usage{
expand_plan(plan, values = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{plan}{workflow plan data frame}

\item{values}{values to expand over. These will be appended to
the names of the new targets.}
}
\value{
An expanded workflow plan data frame (with replicated targets).
}
\description{
Expands a workflow plan data frame by duplicating rows.
This generates multiple replicates of targets with the same commands.
}
\examples{
# Create the part of the workflow plan for the datasets.
datasets <- workplan(
  small = simulate(5),
  large = simulate(50))
# Create replicates. If you want repeat targets,
# this is convenient.
expand_plan(datasets, values = c("rep1", "rep2", "rep3"))
}
