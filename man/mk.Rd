\description{
Internal drake function to be called
inside Makefiles only. Makes a single target.
Users should not need to invoke this function directly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# This function is meant to be part of Makefile recipes for
# make(..., parallelism = "Makefile").
# These examples peer into the internals of drake,
# but are not really of practical use for most users.
load_basic_example() # Load drake's canonical example.
con <- drake_config(my_plan) # Construct the internal configuration list.
# Prepare to use a distributed computing parallel backend
# such as "Makefile" or "future_lapply".
build_these <- drake:::prepare_distributed(config = con)
# Write the dummy timestamp files usually written at the beginning
# of make(..., parallelism = "Makefile").
time_stamps(build_these = build_these, config = con)
# Use mk() to build a target. Usually called inside a Makefile recipe.
mk(target = "small", cache_path = default_cache_path())
