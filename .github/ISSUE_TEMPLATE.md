# Troubleshooting

The ["caution" vignette](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/vignettes/caution.Rmd) (`vignette("caution")`, also linked from the [CRAN page](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake) under "vignettes") lists some known issues, limitations, and edge cases. Please look there first if you encounter problems or unexpected behavior. The ["debug" vignette](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/vignettes/debug.Rmd) (`vignette("debug")`) describes how to debug and test `drake` workflows. If these vignettes do not solve your issue, please search the [issues page](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues), taking care to browse the closed issues as well. If you are still unsatisfied, please submit your bug report, question, or feature reqest as a [new issue](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues/new).
